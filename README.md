# 📚 CMSC 462 Introduction to Data Science

## ✨ Overview
Course repository of assignments, examples, and datasets used to learn core data science skills: data wrangling, visualization, inferential & predictive modeling, association rule mining, and recommender systems. Practical experience with R and Python (Jupyter), working datasets, and model evaluation workflows.

> 📌 Quick Highlight
* Languages: R (primary), Python (Jupyter notebooks)
* Key topics: EDA, ggplot2 visualizations, linear & logistic regression, classification (Naive Bayes), ROC/PR evaluation, association rules (market-basket), recommender systems (MovieLens), basic MongoDB usage
* Tools / libraries: tidyverse, ggplot2, caret, arules, arulesViz, ROCR/pROC, pandas, scikit-learn, pymongo
